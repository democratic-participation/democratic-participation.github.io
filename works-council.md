# What is a Works Council?

Under German law, a works council ("Betriebsrat") represents employee interests and provides a formal channel for workplace participation and protection.

A German works council provides employees with:
- **One Voice, Stronger Together**: A Betriebsrat gives employees a unified, democratic voice in shaping workplace culture and policies, instead of fragmented individual concerns.
- **Fair Representation in a Digital Workplace**: In fast-paced SaaS environments with distributed teams, a works council ensures all employees — from developers to support staff — are equally represented.
- **Structured Dialogue = Better Decisions**: A Betriebsrat provides a legal, structured framework for dialogue with management, avoiding ad hoc conflicts and improving problem-solving.
- **Protecting Rights, Driving Innovation**: Works councils in Germany have co-determination rights on topics like working hours, remote work, and training. This helps balance flexibility with employee well-being — crucial in tech.
- **Shaping the Future of Work in Tech**: SaaS companies face rapid changes due to AI, automation, and agile work models. A Betriebsrat ensures workers’ perspectives shape these transformations early on.
- **Trust Builds Productivity**: Employees who feel heard are more engaged, motivated, and loyal — key for retaining talent in the competitive tech market.

## What a Works Council is not.

A works council is not a replacement for company management. The council's authority focuses on matters that directly
affect employees' social and working conditions. Strategic business decisions fall outside the works council's
co-determination rights.

The works council operates through consultation and negotiation rather than unilateral decision-making. When management
and the works council cannot reach agreement on a matter within the council's jurisdiction, the dispute is referred to
the Conciliation Committee ("Einigungsstelle") for resolution.
