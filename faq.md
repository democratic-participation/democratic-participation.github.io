# Frequently Asked Questions

## Election Process

**Q: What happens at the works meeting on April 9?**
A: The purpose is to elect an election committee, not to vote on whether there will be a works council. If at least 3 employees stand for election and receive votes, an election committee is formed.

**Q: Can we prevent a works council from being established?**
A: If the majority present don't elect an election committee, it may delay the process. However, three employees or a union can still request a labor court to appoint an election committee.

**Q: Is the April 9 vote a decision for/against a works council?**
A: No, it's only to elect an election committee. The committee is then legally obliged to organize works council elections.

## Participation & Eligibility

**Q: Who can participate in the election committee vote?**
A: All employees except employers and senior executives ("leitende Angestellte").

**Q: Who can stand for works council election?**
A: Employees who have worked for the company for at least 6 months and are at least 18 years old.

**Q: Do I need to attend in person?**
A: Yes, only employees physically present at the meeting can vote. Absence doesn't count as abstention.

**Q: How many people need to attend for the vote to be valid?**
A: The law only requires a majority of those present. Theoretically, even 3 out of 650 employees could elect themselves.

## Timeline & Notice

**Q: Why was this organized with short notice?**
A: The law requires only one week's notice. The organizers provided two weeks to give employees more time to prepare.

**Q: Why now and not earlier?**
A: The SE Works Council was established in early 2023. There's no deadline for establishing a national works council.

## Works Council Functions

**Q: What's the difference between SE Works Council and German Works Council?**
A: The German Works Council has stronger codetermination rights (§87 BetrVG) and must be involved in dismissals (§102 BetrVG). It handles national German matters, while SE Works Council handles international issues.

**Q: Can someone be in both councils?**
A: Yes, employees can serve on both the SE Works Council and German Works Council.

**Q: Can a works council be abolished later?**
A: Only if works council members grossly violate their duties (§23 BetrVG). Otherwise, it cannot be abolished simply due to employee dissatisfaction.

## Election Committee

**Q: What does the election committee do?**
A: It prepares and conducts the works council election according to strict legal requirements. The committee has very limited decision-making power and must follow the law.

**Q: Who are the candidates for election committee?**
A: Candidates can only introduce themselves at the election meeting itself. The best candidates should be able to read, understand and apply the relevant laws.

## Company Relations

**Q: Was management involved in initiating this process?**
A: No, the L-Team was not involved. This is neither usual nor necessary for works council establishment.

**Q: How does this protect employees?**
A: The works council represents employee interests, provides advice on rights and obligations, and serves as a mediator in conflicts with management, particularly regarding negative decisions like dismissals or denied vacation.

## Legal Framework

**Q: Which laws govern this process?**
A: Works Constitution Act (BetrVG) and Election Regulation. Resources are available at betriebsrat.de, brwahl.de, and other union websites.

**Q: Is a works council mandatory?**
A: No, unlike the SE Works Council (which was required for converting to SE), a German works council is not mandatory.
