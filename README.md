This site provides information about ongoing efforts to establish a works council for employees in Germany. Under German law, a works council ("Betriebsrat") represents employee interests and provides a formal channel for workplace participation and protection.

### What is a Works Council?

A German works council provides employees with:
- **Representation** in workplace decisions
- **Legal protection** in dismissals and workplace conflicts  
- **Participation rights** in company policies affecting employees
- **Mediation** between management and employees

This is different from the existing SE (European) Works Council, which focuses on international matters.

## Legal Framework

Works councils in Germany are governed by the **Works Constitution Act** (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz - BetrVG). The establishment process is strictly regulated and follows formal legal procedures.

### Process Overview

The establishment process follows these steps:
1. **Employee Initiative** - Three or more employees can call for a works meeting
2. **Election Committee** - Elected to organize the formal works council election
3. **Works Council Election** - Formal election of council members
4. **Council Formation** - Newly elected council begins representing employees
