This site provides information about ongoing efforts to establish a works council for employees in Germany. Other than the existing SE works council, a works council under German law has stronger codetermination rights and must be involved in dismissals.

> **Current Status:** A group of ten employees are in dialogue with the IG Metall Berlin union, as there are clear indications that there is interest in setting up a works council in Germany.

## Establishment Process

Works councils in Germany are governed by the Works Constitution Act (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz - BetrVG). The establishment process is strictly regulated and follows formal legal procedures.

### Steps to Establish a Works Council

1. **Employee Initiative**: Three or more employees can call for a works meeting to initiate the establishment process.
2. **Election Committee Formation**: At the works meeting, employees elect an election committee responsible for organizing and conducting the formal works council election.
3. **Works Council Election**: The election committee oversees the formal election process, where eligible employees vote to elect council members.
4. **Council Formation**: Once elected, the works council is formally established and begins representing employee interests in accordance with the Works Constitution Act.
