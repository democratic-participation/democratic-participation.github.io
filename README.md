This site provides information about ongoing efforts to establish a works council for employees in Germany. Other than the existing SE works council, a works council under German law has stronger codetermination rights and must be involved in dismissals.

> **Current Status:** A group of ten employees are in dialogue with the IG Metall Berlin union, as there are clear indications that there is interest in setting up a works council in Germany.

## What is a Works Council?

Under German law, a works council ("Betriebsrat") represents employee interests and provides a formal channel for workplace participation and protection.

A German works council provides employees with:
- **Representation** in workplace decisions
- **Legal protection** in dismissals and workplace conflicts  
- **Participation rights** in company policies affecting employees
- **Mediation** between management and employees
